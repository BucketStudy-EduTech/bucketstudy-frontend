  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    BucketStudy was born out of a simple observation: too many graduates were struggling to find jobs despite having degrees, while employers were struggling to find candidates with practical skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    Founded in March 2025 in Nashik, Maharashtra, we began with a small batch of interns focused on real-world web development projects. The impact was immediate â€” interns gained hands-on experience that made them more competitive in the job market.
